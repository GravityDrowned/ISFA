      <CMP> Number of labelled increasing unary-binary trees on n nodes whose breadth-first reading word avoids 321.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> The number of labelled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 321 in the classical sense.  The treeâ€™s permutation is found by recording the labels in the order they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root).</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations.</CMP>

      <CMP> When n=4, a(n)=9.  In the Links above we show the nine labelled increasing trees on four nodes whose permutation avoids 321.</CMP>

      <CMP> A245896 gives the number of binary trees instead of unary-binary trees.  A245900 gives the number of permutations which avoid 321 that are breadth-first reading words on labelled increasing unary-binary trees.</CMP>
