      <CMP> a(n) is the number of functions on a finite set {1,...,n} that are not composition powers of any other function or powers(&gt;1) of itself.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> Hard to compute for n&gt;7, as the number of functions to test is n^n.</CMP>
    </omtext><assertion class="example">
      <CMP> For n=2, the set is {1,2} and we have 4 functions: the constants 1 and 2, the identity, and the transposition. Any composition power of a constant function or of identity is the function itself. Odd composition powers of the transposition give the transposition. Thus all 4 functions are represented.</CMP>
    </assertion><assertion class="example">
      <CMP> For n=3, the set is {1,2,3} and f:{1,2,3}-&gt;{1,1,2} can not be represented by composition powers of any other function, or powers of itself (as fof gives the constant function=1). There are 6 functions in this situation (similar).</CMP>
