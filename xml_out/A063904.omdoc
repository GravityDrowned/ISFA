      <CMP> &quot;Does the sequence [above] contain every prime? Is the sequence infinite?&quot; ... &quot;The sequence of problem [above] is not even known to be infinite, though it almost surely contains every prime. We do not know whether anyone has attacked the problem computationally; perhaps you, the reader, would like to give it a try. The problem is due to M. Newman at the Australian Nation University.&quot; - Crandall and Pomerance</CMP>
