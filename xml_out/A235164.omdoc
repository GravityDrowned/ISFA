      <CMP> Numbers whose digits, when the number is written in base n+1, are a permutation of 1...n, and such that for all k in {1,...,n} the first k digits (still in base n+1) form a number divisible by k.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> See sequence A163574 (which lists, for each n, the smallest term with n digits) for further discussion, in particular the proof that n must be odd, and that there is no further term with less than 13 digits.  See sequence A235133 for the version where the terms (up to 9 digits) are written down in base 10.</CMP>
    </omtext><assertion class="example">
      <CMP> The terms with 5 digits in base 6 are 2285 = 14325[6] and 7465 = 54321[6], since these numbers are divisible by 5, and 14[6] = 10, 143[6] = 63, 1432[6] = 380 are divisible by 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and the same is the case for 54[6] = 34, 543[6] = 207 and 5432[6] = 1244.</CMP>
