      <CMP> After 0 and 1, numbers n whose binary representation encodes such a polynomial over GF(2) that all its irreducible factors (their binary codes) are primes in N (terms of A091206).</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> To determine whether n belongs to this sequence: first find an unique multiset of terms i, j, ..., k (terms not necessarily distinct) from A014580 for which i x j x ... x k = n, where x stands for the carryless multiplication (A048720). If and only if NONE of those i, j, ..., k is a composite (in other words, if all are primes in N, i.e. terms of A091206), then n is a member.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> Equally, numbers which can be constructed as p x q x ... x r, where p, q, ..., r are terms of A091206. (Compare to the definition of A236860.)</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> Also fixed points of A236851(n). Proof: if k is a term of this sequence, the operation described in A236851 reduces to an identity operation. On the other hand, if k is not a term of this sequence, then it contains at least one irreducible GF(2)[X]-factor which is a composite in N, which is thus &quot;broken&quot; by A236851 to two or more separate GF(2)[X]-factors (either irreducible or not), and because the original factor was irreducible, and GF(2)[X] is a unique factorization domain, the new product computed over the new set of factors (with one or more &quot;broken&quot; pieces) cannot be equal to the original k. (Compare this to how primes are &quot;broken&quot; in a similar way in A235027, also A235145).</CMP>

      <CMP> Also by similar to above reasoning, positions where A234742(n) = A236837(n).</CMP>

      <CMP> This is a subsequence of A236841, from which this differs for the first time at n=43, where A236841(43)=43, while from here 43 is missing, and a(43)=44.</CMP>

      <CMP> 25 is the first term not included, as although it encodes an irreducible polynomial in GF(2)[X]: X^4 + X^3 + 1 (binary code 11001), it is composite in Z, thus not in A091206, but in A091214.</CMP>

      <CMP> 27 is included, as it factors as 5 x 7, and both factors are present in A091206.</CMP>

      <CMP> 37 is included, as it is a member of A091206 (irreducible in both Z and GF(2)[X]).</CMP>

      <CMP> 43 it NOT included because, even although it is a prime in Z, it factors as 3 x 25 in GF(2)[X]. Of these, only 3 is a term of A091206, while 25 belongs to A091214, as it further divides to 5*5.</CMP>
