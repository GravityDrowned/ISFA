      <CMP> Consider natural numbers N : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, .... For these numbers, we introduce the definitions: Peace T - the set of all numbers N, in which the whole of T divisors (including 1 and the sheer number N); number of the world - the number (T) for any integer divisors of the number N of this world; odd world - a world with an odd number of T = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...; even the world - a world with even number of T = 2, 4, 6, 8, ...; leader of the world T - the number of N, whose first time (in the natural numbers), you are the type T;</CMP>

      <CMP> top leaders of the odd worlds - the leaders (of N) of odd worlds, in which the number of T is monotonically increasing (in the natural numbers), starting with T = 1; even the worlds top leaders - the leaders (of N) of even the worlds in which the number of T is monotonically increasing (in the natural numbers), starting from T = 2. Given these definitions it is easy to find an infinite sequence leaders (N) odd worlds (with the odd T).</CMP>
