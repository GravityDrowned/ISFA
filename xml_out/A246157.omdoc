      <CMP> 35 in binary is 100011, which encodes polynomial x^5 + x + 1, which factorizes as (x^2 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1) over GF(2) (35 = A048720(7,13)), thus it is reducible in that polynomial ring.</CMP>

      <CMP> Also, it is odd (the least significant bit is 1, that is, the constant term is not zero) and also odious, as there are three 1-bits (nonzero terms) present. Thus, 35 is included in this sequence.</CMP>
