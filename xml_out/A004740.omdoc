      <CMP> Jasper Mulder, Jan 25 2010, comments that this sequence is ill-defined, since there are an infinite number of cardinal numbers that start with a 'd', namely all those powers of 10 named decillion, duodecillion and so on (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals). [Obviously Smarandache did not take such numbers into account. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 25 2010.]</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> However, it would seem then that 'billion' and 'centillion' also precede these, while it is standard (and systematic for this sequence) to refer to such numbers as 'one billion', 'one decillion' etc. - Yasiru Ratnayake, May 03 2012</CMP>
