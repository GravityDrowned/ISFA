    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> An &quot;up-down signature&quot; of the permutation (p(1),p(2),p(3),...,p(n)) is the sequence of (n-1) signs (+ or -) where the k-th sign in the sequence is the sign of (p(k+1)-p(k)). All permutations of {1,2,3,...,n} which are their own inverses obviously have the same up-down signature as their inverse permutations.</CMP>

      <CMP> The up-down signature of the permutation (4,2,6,3,5,1) is -+-+-. This permutation's inverse permutation is (6,2,4,1,5,3). The inverse permutation also has the up-down signature -+-+-. So these two permutations, among others, are included in the count for n = 6.</CMP>
