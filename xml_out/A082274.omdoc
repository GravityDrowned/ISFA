      <CMP> The above conjecture is true. Adding two to the least significant digit of a number can result in a carry of at most 1, which only happens if the digit of least significance is 8 or 9. If the least significant digit is 8, adding two results in that digit becoming 0, so the resulting number can't be palindromic. If only the k least and most significant digits are 9, the least significant digit will become 1 and all other adjacent digits 9 will turn into the digit 0 and produce a carry of 1. For the starting number to have been palindromic, the k most significant digits must also be 9s. Any digits that are not 9s between the 9s will not produce a carry on their own when increased by one through the previous carry, resulting in a nonpalindromic number with some 9s as most significant digits and a single 1 and 0s as least significant digits. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jul 22 2014</CMP>
