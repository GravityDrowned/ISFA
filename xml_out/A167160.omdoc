      <CMP> From table 1 on p.5 of Sikiric, who abstracts: an i-hedrite is a 4-regular plane graph with faces of size 2, 3 and 4. We do a short survey of their known properties and explain some new algorithms that allow their efficient enumeration. Using this we give the symmetry groups of all i-hedrites and the minimal representative for each. We also review the link of 4-hedrites with knot theory and the classification of 4-hedrites with simple central circuits. An i-self-hedrite is a self-dual plane graph with faces and vertices of size/degree 2, 3 and 4. We give a new efficient algorithm for enumerating them based on i-hedrites. We give a classification of their possible symmetry groups and a classification of 4-self-hedrites of symmetry T, Td in terms of the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. Then we give a method for enumerating 4-self-hedrites with simple zigzags.</CMP>
