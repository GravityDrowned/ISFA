# ISFA

The *ISFA* project is a database of *I*nteger *S*equence *F*ormulas and *A*pplications. The integer sequence formulas are parsed from the [OEIS](http://oeis.org).

A more detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/eluzhnica/ISFA/blob/master/docs/Enxhell_Luzhnica_BSC.pdf).

## Parts

The ISFA is currently composed of:

- A parser for math formulas found in the OEIS.
- A program that find relations between OEIS sequences. Relations in simple text format (due to space limitations) are available [here](https://github.com/eluzhnica/ISFA/tree/master/results/relations).
- A MathWebSearch instance for OEIS documents (http://oeissearch.mathweb.org)
- A parser for an improved formula language for the OEIS.
